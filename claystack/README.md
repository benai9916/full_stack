### Data representation
I had two option to chose for data representation
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
Adjacency is good for graph with lots of connections, in out case we have limited connections so i decided to use adjacency list 
```
A: B5, D5, E7
B: C4
C: D8, E2
D: C8, E6
E: B3
```

### How to run
- clone the repositotry
- cd to project directory `cd claystack`
- run `python main.py`

### How to run test case
- `python test.py`
